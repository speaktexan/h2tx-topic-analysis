One time we tied a rope to a limb of a cypress tree and we'd swing out on a vine and the spring I'd fly kites and on summer nights we'd catch fireflies, but we called 'em lightning bugs. Once in a while we'd have fights with corn cobs or pine cones. In the winter, we'd build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a live wire when I was 19, I went to work in Dallas at a fire store, Firestone Tire Company.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"participant","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"livelihood and economy","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"sense of place","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://speaktexan.github.io/h2tx-topic-analysis/h2_tx_tell_north_texas_topic_analysis/canvas/1#t=4831,4889"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://speaktexan.github.io/h2tx-topic-analysis/h2_tx_tell_north_texas_topic_analysis/canvas/1/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"I didn't like city life and for a long time I'd go home every chance I got. Mama would always cook my favorite food. Fried oak hopping, John, that's rice and black-eyed peas and pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but going home is not the same. Now. After dad died, mama sold the farm, moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city. But my wife and kids don't understand me. When I gripe about city life and talk about moving to the country, my oldest child says, daddy, that's crazy. I'll just die if I had to live on a farm. I almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing, but I try to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots. While we may live in a city, I want my kids to have a good feed feeling for the land, have a sense of place, take pride in being Texans, and if they lose our ties to the land, the price of progress is too high.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"participant","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"change","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"generational relations","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"sense of place","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://speaktexan.github.io/h2tx-topic-analysis/h2_tx_tell_north_texas_topic_analysis/canvas/1#t=4891,4957"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://speaktexan.github.io/h2tx-topic-analysis/h2_tx_tell_north_texas_topic_analysis/canvas/1/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Alright, perfect.
